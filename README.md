# The Repository of Misfit Go

Here there be broken toys written in the Go programming language. It's named after [Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Island of Misfit Toys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_the_Red-Nosed_Reindeer_and_the_Island_of_Misfit_Toys). So, that's what this is. A bunch of toy experiments that are more likely to be broken nonsense than anything useful becaused I wanted to play with something and then move on but I'm also a bit of a packrat.
